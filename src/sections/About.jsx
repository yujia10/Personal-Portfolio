            <p>
              I'm a passionate software engineer with over 5 years of experience
              crafting digital products that make a difference. My journey
              started with a curiosity for how things work on the web, and it
              has evolved into a deep expertise in modern frontend technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, building
              everything from sleek landing pages to complex enterprise
              applications. My approach combines technical excellence with a
              keen eye for design and user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
              contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with
              the developer community.
